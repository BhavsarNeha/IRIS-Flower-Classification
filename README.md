# 🌸 IRIS Flower Classification

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the **application of Machine Learning using Python** to classify the famous **Iris flower dataset**.  
The goal is to predict the species of an Iris flower (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) based on features such as **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.

The Iris dataset is a classic example for beginners in machine learning, as it is simple yet powerful for understanding key concepts in **supervised learning**.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Implement multiple **supervised learning algorithms** for classification.
- Train and test models on the **Iris dataset** using scikit-learn tools.
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance using standard metrics.
- Provide an easy-to-understand workflow for beginners in ML.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
The project explores and compares the performance of several algorithms from the **scikit-learn** library:

- 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**
- 🤝 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- ⚙️ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- 📈 **Logistic Regression**

Each algorithm is trained, tested, and evaluated using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and visual plots.

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **scikit-learn**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**

## 📊 Dataset Information
The **Iris dataset** contains 150 records of iris flowers, divided equally among three species:
- *Iris Setosa*  
- *Iris Versicolor*  
- *Iris Virginica*

Each sample has the following features:
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| Sepal Length | Length of the sepal (in cm) |
| Sepal Width | Width of the sepal (in cm) |
| Petal Length | Length of the petal (in cm) |
| Petal Width | Width of the petal (in cm) |

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Import the dataset**  
2. **Preprocess the data** (feature selection, normalization)  
3. **Split the dataset** using `train_test_split()`  
4. **Train models** using multiple algorithms  
5. **Evaluate model accuracy** using metrics from `sklearn.metrics`  
6. **Visualize results** through graphs and confusion matrices  

---

## 📈 Results
The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy.  
All models performed well, with **SVM** and **Logistic Regression** giving the **highest accuracy (~97–100%)** on the test data.
